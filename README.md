# JS_SAST
Static Application Security Testing Analyzer for JavaScript Source Code. 
JS_SAST uses regular expressions to build its rulesets. These rulesets are being used by the tool to
detect vulnerabilities, flaws, and bugs within JavaScript code. 
The tool will scan each line in the JavaScript code file and
check the code against various of the custom rulesets that identify vulnerable code.

## FAQ

#### Will JS_SAST catch all vulnerabilities, flaws, or bugs within JavaScript source code?

No, If the rule for a certain vulnerability or a bug is not implemented/supported, the tool will not catch it. Check the documentation section to learn how to add support to a new rule.

#### Where are the rulesets located?

The rulesets are located in core/ruleset.yaml
