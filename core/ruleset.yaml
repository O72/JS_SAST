    Remove hard-coded credentials, such as passwords and tokens from source code.
    Alternatively, store them in configuration files or environment variables
    If possible, store them in a secure location with restricted access, such as a vault.

  description: "Learn More: (https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)"
  remediation: |
    Sanitize the passed data or use variable references to safely embed it without altering the structure of the expression,
    if the user input must be included in an XPath expression. Alternatively, use variable replacement mechanism provided by XPATH

  remediation: |
    To protect against untrusted URL redirection, it is recommended to avoid passing user input directly into a redirect URL.
    Instead, whitelist authorized redirects on the server.
